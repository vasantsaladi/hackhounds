  "prompt": "A conceptual illustration that tells the story of KQTV and its broadcasting history. Split the image into two halves: one side showcasing vintage television imagery and the early days of broadcasting with retro colors, and the other side featuring modern technology and a digital screen highlighting current affiliations like ABC and Ion Television. Use a harmonious palette of warm oranges and cool blues to blend nostalgia with contemporary relevance, while employing visual metaphors such as an old television morphing into a sleek digital device. Include minimal text, like 'History' and 'Now,' to guide the viewer while maintaining visual storytelling."
