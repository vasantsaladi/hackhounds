  "description": "The Suicide of Rachel Foster is a gripping adventure video game that immerses players in the haunting atmosphere of the Timberline Hotel in December 1993. Players follow Nicole Wilson as she returns to her family's abandoned hotel to confront the past and seek closure after a decade of silence. The game explores themes of memory, grief, and uncovering dark secrets within a beautifully rendered, eerie environment.",
  "prompt": "Create a moody and atmospheric scene depicting the Timberline Hotel, a large, old and somewhat dilapidated building surrounded by snow-covered mountains and trees. The hotel should have a sense of abandonment, with broken windows and ghostly light emanating from inside. In the foreground, feature a young woman, Nicole Wilson, with an expression of determination and sorrow, holding a retainer that symbolizes her connection to the past. The sky should be overcast, adding to the somber tone of the scene."
