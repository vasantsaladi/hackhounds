  "description": "On April 26, 1986, reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, marking one of the most severe nuclear accidents in history. The disaster, caused by reactor design flaws and operator error, resulted in immediate casualties and long-term radiation effects, and remains a pivotal event in nuclear history.",
  "prompt": "An educational infographic illustrating the key elements of the Chernobyl disaster. The diagram should feature a timeline from the explosion to subsequent radiation effects, with clear icons for nuclear reactors, explosion, radiation symbols, casualty figures, and geographic coordinates. Use a clean, professional layout with clear labels and a color scheme dominated by dark blues, grays, and reds to emphasize urgency and historical impact."
