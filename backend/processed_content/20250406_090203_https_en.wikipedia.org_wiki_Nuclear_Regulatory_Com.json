  "description": "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is a vital independent agency of the U.S. government, established to ensure public health and safety in relation to nuclear energy. Founded in 1975, the NRC oversees reactor safety, licensing, and security, playing a crucial role in the management of nuclear power in the United States.",
  "prompt": "A modern government building representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, located in North Bethesda, Maryland. The scene includes a clear blue sky, a large sign displaying 'Nuclear Regulatory Commission', people engaged in discussions outside the building, and elements symbolizing nuclear energy, such as a reactor silhouette and safety signs. The architecture should reflect a sense of authority and security, showcasing the balance between technology and public safety."
