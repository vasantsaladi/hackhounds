  "title": "Unraveling Mystery at Timberline Hotel",
  "description": "The Suicide of Rachel Foster is a 2020 adventure game where players follow Nicole Wilson as she confronts her family's haunting past while exploring a deserted hotel. The story intertwines themes of grief, family secrets, and the emotional aftermath of tragedy, set against a backdrop of a snowstorm that traps her within the hotel.",
  "prompt": "A primarily artistic scene that captures the eerie atmosphere of the Timberline Hotel while subtly communicating key story elements. Create a hauntingly beautiful interior of an abandoned hotel, with shadows hinting at past events, and incorporate visual symbols such as a snow-covered window to signify isolation, a retainer representing Rachel's presence, and scattered puzzle pieces symbolizing Nicole's quest for truth. Use a color palette of cool blues and grays contrasted with warm, faded browns to convey mystery and nostalgia. The image should feel captivating and atmospheric, with a focus on artistic interpretation and minimum textual elements."
